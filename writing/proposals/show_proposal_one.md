## 🎉 Show Description

The show will include a guest from the Registrar’s Office who will speak about the different tracks and concentrations a student can take (either specific to Allegheny or broadly). We will discuss what tracks are and how they differ from majors and minors. Some people may not want to do a track and that’s completely fine! And some people may not know what a track even is. But that’s what this episode is about! All about finding out different tracks and what they are.

As we go on in the episode, we’ll also dive into specific tracks. Popular ones include pre-med/pre-health, pre-law, etc. We will discuss the requirements for this track and what it’ll help with post college. We will also talk briefly about the difficulties when taking these tracks.

Then, we will discuss the benefits on being on a track specific course in college. This will help aspiring students finally decide if they want to be track specific or not. We might also discuss the different pros and cons of being in a track as well. Or the best majors to follow for a track you’re thinking of.

## 📢 Call to Action

I want people to be open to more than just majors and minors, especially those looking into graduate school. People usually take the easiest route and also don't do much research, so I hope this episode allows them to look into tracks and concentrations.
